# Blueberry

## What

Blueberry is a free software for creating a diary about your daily life.

## Why

I was trying to build something bigger - a repository called fyesta - but I realized that trying to build something too big alone leaves some flaws along the way, which can be interpreted as carelessness or lack of attention, but it is more due to the wear and tear of thinking about how to solve all the most complex problems in a singular way and not globally. Thinking about it, I extracted one of the features of that project, restructured it in the next app dir, and I'm building it here. This time, I intend to deliver it 100%.
